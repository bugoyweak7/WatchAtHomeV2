## 2026-11-13 — Profile backend APIs

- Added authenticated profile list/upsert/delete and profile-lock routes to the existing Cloudflare Worker.
- Added profile-settings GET/PUT synchronization with JSON round-trip preservation, including unknown/future keys.
- Enforced Firebase UID ownership, active-account/profile checks, six-profile bounds, request-size limits and rate limiting; enabled PUT/DELETE in Worker CORS.
- Added profile storage and HTTP tests. GitHub Actions run 43381569837 passed TypeScript and all 52 tests (0 failures).
- D1 remains draft-only and unprovisioned. No mobile Supabase adapter, production setting, secret, or deployment was changed.


## 2026-11-13 — Add-ons, Plugins and Collections migration backend

- Added authenticated per-profile GET/PUT Worker routes for installed add-ons, plugin repository selections, and collection blobs.
- Implemented whole-snapshot replacement semantics, profile ownership, bounded validation, duplicate URL checks, and rate limiting.
- Extended draft profile_plugins schema to match legacy row fields; retained Firestore shared add-on catalogue separation.
- Preserved complete collection JSON including unknown fields. Kept plugin scraper code/manifests on their existing repository/local-cache flow.
- Added eight SQLite storage tests and HTTP route ownership coverage. GitHub Actions run 43382547116 passed all 61 tests and TypeScript compilation (0 failures).
- D1 remains draft-only; no mobile adapter, UI, player, production resource, secret, data, or deployment changed.

## 2026-11-13 — Verified migration status baseline

- Audited the newest User App branch `setup/firebase-cloudflare-zero-cost` at commit `c4b106b8b994154208d2672f381750cf29665352` and inspected the Admin App repository on `main`.
- Confirmed the User App authentication repository still uses Supabase, including email/password auth and anonymous sign-in; Firebase Android configuration, SDK dependencies and an Android Firebase backend wrapper are present but do not yet replace the main auth repository.
- Confirmed Supabase profile/library/watch-progress adapters and Supabase runtime configuration remain in source.
- Confirmed Worker premium/trial and additional account/profile APIs exist, while D1 remains draft-only and no D1 binding is present in the inspected Wrangler configuration.
- Confirmed Admin App Firebase Auth/Firestore integration and shared `watchathome-admin` Firebase project configuration.
- Added `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as the verified source-of-truth status record. Live Firebase rules, Cloudflare secrets, D1 provisioning and deployed Worker state remain unverified.
- Documentation-only audit: no app source, database rules, cloud resources, secrets or deployments were changed.
